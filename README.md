# WindBnB
An AirBnB clone. Challenge gotten from [devChallenges.](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/3JFYedSOZqAxYuOCNmYD)

## Technologies Used
- Create React App
- Tailwind CSS

## Features
- Responsive Design
- Dropdown menu
- Filters based on Location

## Demo
- [Demo Here](https://windbnb-areezy.vercel.app/ "https://windbnb-areezy.vercel.app/")

## Remarks
- My first project built in react so I took the opportunity to experiment on various syntax and coding styles. That explains the different function definition styles.
- [ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) is an incredible extension.
- Writing tailwind was a fun experience for sure but the cluttered jsx might be undesirable, I will experiment with CSS modules next.
